# notarize.sh - Submit a signed agentcookie binary to Apple's notary
# service. After notarization Apple stamps the binary with a ticket and
# every Mac accepts it without Gatekeeper interactive approval, on any
# launch path (shell exec, LaunchAgent, Finder double-click).
#
# Prerequisites:
#   1. The binary is signed with Developer ID + Hardened Runtime
#      (scripts/sign.sh produces this shape).
#   2. xcrun notarytool credentials are stored in the login keychain
#      under the profile name in AGENTCOOKIE_NOTARY_PROFILE (default:
#      "agentcookie-notary"). One-time setup:
#
#         xcrun notarytool store-credentials agentcookie-notary \
#           --apple-id mvanhorn@gmail.com \
#           --team-id NM8VT393AR \
#           --password <app-specific-password-from-appleid.apple.com>
#
#      See docs/runbook-v0.12-codesign.md for the appleid.apple.com path.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/notarize.sh <binary> [<binary> ...]
#
# Each invocation waits for Apple's verdict (5-30 min typical). Exits
# zero only when ALL submitted binaries are accepted.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  all binaries notarized and stapled
#   1  usage error
#   2  notary profile not found in login keychain
#   3  notarization rejected by Apple (see log URL in output)
#   4  staple failed
